//brief discussion of the source files:

1. StackADT.java-> Stack ADT(Abstract Data Type)
2. AStack.java-> Array based stack(Arr) implementation code using stack ADT
3. LStack.java-> Linked list implementation code using stack ADT
4. Item.java-> A class that is needed in the implementation code of LStack.java/Linked list.
5. main.java-> It contains a simple main function to demonstrate that all the functions are working properly, for both implementations. 
               This main function should work for both the implementation except forthe object instantiation part.
6. DishWasher.java-> A dishwashing problem implementation using the Arr, Linked List implementations and one array,2 stacks implementation
